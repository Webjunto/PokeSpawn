                Tap on the "Nearby" Pokemon in the bottom right corner of your screen and take a look at the visual representation.  One footprint is close, 3 is far.  

              </p>
              <p>
                Self explanatory right? WRONG. There's a trick here - the pokemon are listed in order.  Pick any direction (North, South, East, West) and start walking.  If the pokemon you want gets further down the list, turn around!  If it get's closer, keep going.

              <h2>Tip #2:  <i>How do I catch rare pokemon?</i></h2>

              <div style="font-size:20px;">
                <p>
                  <br>
                  Alright, there's a couple things you need to be aware of...
                </p>
                <p>
                  1. Rasberries.  They are an item you get from Pokestops that you can use DURING the combat with a wild pokemon.  If you use it, your NEXT throw will have a higher chance of success.  If you miss though, you will have to re-use another rasberry as the effect diminishes!
                </p>
                <img src="https://shopsmart.xyz/shopping-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pokemongo1.jpg" class="pull-right" style="width:350px;height:550px;margin-top:15px;margin-left:15px;">
                <p>
                  2.  The Circles.  The circle that surrounds a pokemon designates how hard it is for you to catch.  Green is easy.  Yellow is medium.  Red hints are harder.  PAY ATTENTIO TO THE CIRCLE SIZE!  The smaller the circle and the closer to the center, the better your odds at getting the pokemon!   Plus, you'll get a small XP Bonus for a great or nice shot.
                  <br><br>
                  If you use a Rasberry on a red pokemon it MAY not catch; however there is a 3rd trick that can be combined with the above 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3.  The Curveball.  Or the Curve Pokeball.   This is the 'skill-shot' in pokemon.  Take your finger and hold down on the pokeball.  Start swirling your finger (very fast) in a small circular pattern.
                  <br><br>
                  No, I am not messing with you.
                  <br><br>
                  
                  Once you get it spinning fast enough it will start to show stars.  That's a curve ball!  Release it and throw up simultaneously trying to hit the pokemon like normal.   If you hit it, you'll have a higher chance of success.  If you do a Curveball AND a Great Shot (in the center), you'll have even better.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b><i>Note:  If you use a combination of Rasberry, Great Shot, and Curveball on the SAME throw, I believe you are almost guaranteed to get the pokemon.  I have never had a pokemon escape with all 3</i></b>
